# Project Name: Merchandise Category Clustering
This is my course project for DSC-550 here at Bellevue University. This project is to use unsupervised methdologies to cluster taxonomy categories from different retailers to a unified taxonomy. At the current stage, I focus on the first tier taxonomy of products. TF-IDF topic modelling, TF-IDF+K-Means, and Bert-Senetence embedding+K-means clustering have been implemented.

## Installation
The code requires Python versions of 3.* and general libraries.
