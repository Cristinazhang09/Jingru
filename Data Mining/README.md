# Project Name: Data Mining
In this assignment, I implemented the Closed Itemset Mining and derivable itemset from scratch.

## Installation
The code requires Python versions of 3.* and general libraries.

## Project Motivation and Description
The purpose of this project is to deepen the understanding of the fundamentals of data mining, such as closed itemset mining and derivable itemset through implementation from scratch. 

## Results
Closed itemset mining and derivable itemset were successfully implemented using Python, as well as the built-in itertools and collections libaries in Python.
The correctness of the implementation was verified through predifined test sets.
