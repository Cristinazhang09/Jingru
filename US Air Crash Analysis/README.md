The purpose of this project is using Tableau to build a dashboard to tell a story about the current status of US Airline Crash through effective data visulaization.

## Installation
It requires Tableau.

## Project Motivation and Description
The purpose of this project is to provide a unbiased story about the current status of US airline crash to address the unfortunate airline crashes and biased reports from the media.
An executive summary was prepared for the senior leaders who care about the portrayal of the industry, specifically, the airlines.

## Results
I provided the visualization for the decrease of airline accidents (total and fatal) from 2000-2018, the much lower fatalities of airline crash as compared to other traffics, 
the increase of aircraft passengers to showcase the confidence of customers in airline, I also plotted a comparision of the number of accidents between different airlines as well as the most likely reasons for air crash, finally, I discussed the model wise fatal crash rates per millions of flights and model wise full loss equivalent per millions of flights. Aircraft models of Boeing 737, 727 and Boeing D29 were found to have high full loss equivalent. Suggestion of more strict inspections being performed regarding these models are provided.
