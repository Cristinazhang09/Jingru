# Project Name: Is Airlines Still the Safest

The purpose of this project is using Tableau to build a dashboard to tell a story about airline safety through effective data visulaization.

## Installation
It requires Tableau.

## Project Motivation and Description
In January 2020, a Boeing 737-800 operating as Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 from Tehran, Iran to Kyiv, Ukraine, crashes shortly after takeoff from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport, killing all 167 passengers and 9 crew. In February 2020, a Boeing 737-800 operating Pegasus Airlines Flight 2193 from Izmir skids off the runway on landing at Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, and breaks into pieces. Three people were killed and 179 injured. These tragedies raised great concern over the airline safety, as it looks like more and more fetal airline accidents are happening. Is airline still the safest mean of transportation?
In this project, the safety of airline was analyzed and shown through effect data visualization through Tableau as well as the comparison of the safetiness of airline with other transportations.

## Results
United States based airlines are not among the airlines having high death per seat rate. The possibility to have a fatal accident through air is extremely low (less than 3% per
100,000 departures). And the death rate of airline is much lower than that of other means of transportation. Airline is still regarded as the safest mean of transportation, as witness by the increase of passengers and passenger load factor, respectively.
